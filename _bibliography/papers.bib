  abstract={We propose a method for automatically tuning robotic simulator system parameters to match the real world using only raw RGB images. Our key insight is to reframe the auto-tuning of parameters as a search problem where we iteratively shift the simulation system parameters to approach the real-world system parameters. We show improvements over domain randomization in simulation and on a real robot.},

  abstract={We propose a method to improve the generation of coherent long-form text by having the model first generate an outline, then generate full text conditioned on the outline. This improves perplexity but does not improve human evaluation.},

  code={https://github.com/hmc-cs-mdrissi/neural_nets_research},
  abstract={We modify existing encoder/decoder approaches for translation between programming language abstract syntax trees by using a grammar-aware decoder which is constrained to only generate syntactically correct programs. This improves performance on a couple synthetic tasks.},
