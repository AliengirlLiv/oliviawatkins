I try to tell robots what to do. Most of the time they don’t listen.


About Me: I’m a third-year PhD student in BAIR: Berkeley AI Research group. I work with Pieter Abbeel and Trevor Darrel. The research question I’m most excited about is how to enable humans to teach robots tasks with efficient, natural, low-effort supervision.  More concretely, I’m enthusiastic about human-in-the-loop teaching for robotics and unsupervised representation learning methods which will enable robots to learn representations from large-scale data which can make task-specific human supervision downstream more efficient.

In my spare time I play Quidditch, hang out with friends, make mediocre puns, and procrastinate on keeping my website up to date.
